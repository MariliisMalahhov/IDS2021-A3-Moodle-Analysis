This is a data science introductory course project. The code is contained in a jupyter notebook. It is used to import the data from a .csv file, create plots based on the data and train a classification model called Random Forest Classifier to predict grades. Every step is explained in the code.

How to run the code: download the notebook and the data file. This code uses panda, numpy, matplotlib and sklearn, so these libraries should be installed. Options for running the notebook: command line, Anaconda Navigator, any suitable program for interpreting Python, such as PyCharm or VSCode. Online options include Google Colaboratory.
